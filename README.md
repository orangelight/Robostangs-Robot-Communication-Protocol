Robostangs-Robot-Communication-Protocol (RRCP)
=======================================

Robostangs...?

Add RRCPServer & RRCPCommandHandler to the robot code when Theyâ€™re done.
Use RRCPClient to connect to the robot server from a client.
Use RRCPComputerTestServer & RRCPComputerTestCommandHandler if you dont have a robot cRIO to test on the computer.
