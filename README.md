Robostangs-Robot-Communication-Protocol (RRCP)
=======================================

Robostangs...?

Add RRCPServer & RRCPCommandHandler to the robot code when Theyâ€™re done.
Use RRCPClient to connect to the robot server from a client.
Use RRCPComputerTestServer & RRCPComputerTestCommandHandler if you dont have a robot cRIO to test on the computer.

Example command that echos a string you give it. "ECHO" is the name:
```
static RRCPCommand echo = new RRCPCommand(("ECHO")) {
        @Override
        public void execute(DataOutputStream dos, Object data) {
            String message = (String)data;
            System.out.println("ECHOING: "+message);
            this.sendString(message, dos);
        }
};
```
Example of how to send the ECHO command:
```
rrcpc.readStringPacket(rrcpc.sendCommandWithString("ECHO", "Test String"));
*rrcpc is an instance of RRCPCleint
```

To get a double in the execute method use: 
```
double d = ((Double)data).doubleValue();
```
Set a RRCPCommand name to SOCKETCLOSED and it will be called when a client timesout or disconnects.
Android now supported!!!


Things to do
=======================================
- [x] Byte arrays
- [ ] Maybe have robot server be able to send commands to client
- [x] Make reading date from server thread safe
- [ ] Make sure everything works
